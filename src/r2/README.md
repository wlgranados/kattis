## Problem Description 

The number `S` is
    called the mean of two numbers `R_1` and `R_2` if `S` is equal to `(R_1+R_2)/2`. Mirko’s birthday
    present for Slavko was two integers `R_1` and `R_2`. Slavko promptly calculated
    their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost
    `R_2`! Help Slavko restore
    `R_2`.

## Input

The first and only line of input contains two integers
    `R_1` and `S`, both between `-1\, 000` and `1\, 000`.

## Output

Output `R_2` on a
    single line.
